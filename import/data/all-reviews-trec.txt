<TITLE>Watch Your Storage</TITLE>
Took iPad to apple store because there was no more storage left. This app was the problem. Even though movies had been deleted, it didn't free up the disk space. With just 4 movies downloaded in this app, the app was using over 20GB's. Deleted the app and went with a different player.

<TITLE>What?? No book mark feature??</TITLE>
Simple, straight forward, easy to use app, only disappointment is no book mark feature. How could you leave that out? Please fix this. By the way, so far the app plays anything I throw at it.

<TITLE>No sound</TITLE>
Video appears, no problem, but there's no sound! Very disappointed considering the cost of this app. Notified their help department, but no reply yet. Will update this review I'm contacted with a "fix" .

<TITLE>Awesome</TITLE>
Got it for my b-day I was so excited to fly it. It's kinda hard to control if there is a slight breeze or something but over it's awesome and fun for everyone. (it's also a great fan if you stand under while hovering)
